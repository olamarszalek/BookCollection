#### General Info
This project shows a collection of book cards that contain info about the title, author (author's bio if exists), description, rating and book cover photo. There is also a view to add a new book to the collection and fill in the info that is not yet available in the mock database.

#### Technologies
* React
* React Router
* Typescript
* Material UI
* JSON Server
* Axios

#### Setup
To run the App, after using the npm start script, use npm run start-mock-be in the terminal. This will start the db.json database and only then the book collection would appear.

#### Status and what could be improved
The app is already functioning, so most of the next steps and possible improvements include styling, RWD for the Home page, perhaps a contact form to receive suggestions for the next books to read and review.
