              I started my coding adventure with Software Development Academy's
              "Javascript for Beginners" course in 2022. This decision was
              inspired by past experiences with managing a Wordpress company
              site and working in email marketing, where each bug had to be
              solved by more qualified IT specialists. Naturally, this sparked
              my curiosity and I've been learning HTML, CSS, GIT, JavaScript,
              React.js ever since. I plan to grow as a Frontend Developer and
              learn Node.js in the nearest future. Currently, I work as a
              Marketing Campaign Specialist, although I have also worked in
              Sales and Customer Service. I hold a Master's degree in
              Comparative Literature and continue learning Spanish.

                With SDA, I took part in a Javascript for Beginners course that
                spanned over 10 months and covered basic and advanced HTML, CSS and
                Javascript. On top of that, the course included GIT and CMS
                workshops. We got to practice creating projects using Bootstrap
                and Material UI, but the main focus in the last months was
                React.js.

                Specialist in an international team focused mostly on
                centralized email marketing campaigns. At MT, I got to work with

                being responsible for successful send-outs for the biggest
                division at the company, I also manage international marketing
